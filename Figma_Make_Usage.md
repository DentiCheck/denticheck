# Figma Make Usage

## Problem Definition and Target User

DentiCheck addresses a common gap in oral healthcare: many users experience symptoms but hesitate to visit a dentist because they are unsure about the severity of their condition.

Our primary target users are:

- Individuals who delay dental visits due to uncertainty
- Users interested in preventive oral care but lacking medical knowledge
- Users concerned about treatment cost and insurance options

We identified that users need a simple and guided flow that moves them from image upload to actionable decision-making.

## How We Used Figma Make

We used Figma Make as the starting point to conceptualize DentiCheck and build the initial interactive prototype.

Rather than focusing only on visual design, we focused on validating a clear and practical user flow before finalizing backend implementation.

The prototype consisted of 3–5 connected screens:

- Onboarding screen introducing the value proposition
- Image upload screen for capturing or selecting a dental photo
- Analysis result screen displaying risk level and summary
- Report detail screen with explanation and PDF download option
- Clinic or insurance exploration screen for next-step actions

This clickable prototype allowed us to test the interaction logic and user journey early in the development process.

## Primary User Flow

Onboarding → Image Upload → AI Analysis → Risk Level Display → Report Review → Clinic or Insurance Exploration

This flow was designed to ensure that users do not stop at viewing results, but naturally transition toward meaningful action.

Using Figma Make, we iterated on:

- Clarity of risk presentation
- Simplicity of explanation layout
- Placement of action buttons (e.g., clinic search, insurance lookup)
- Overall usability and interaction logic

## Clear User Value

Through prototyping in Figma Make, we validated several key insights:

- Risk levels must be visually simple and immediately understandable
- Explanations should focus on recommended actions rather than lengthy medical text
- Immediate transition from analysis results to clinic exploration significantly improves usability

Figma Make enabled us to refine the user experience before full technical integration, ensuring that the final product delivers clear and measurable user value.

## How the Idea Can Grow Beyond the Prototype

Although the current prototype demonstrates a complete user flow, the concept is designed to scale further:

- Personalized preventive product recommendations
- Insurance plan matching based on risk profile
- Risk history tracking dashboard
- Direct clinic booking integration
- Enhanced AI chatbot consultation

Figma Make served not just as a design tool, but as a strategic starting point for validating usability, business direction, and long-term scalability.
